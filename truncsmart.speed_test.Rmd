#### Prepare test

```{r, echo=TRUE}
textstring <- "This is a long string that needs to be Truncated. This is a long string that needs to be Truncated. This is a long string that needs to be truncated. This is a long string that needs to be truncated, and so this is a LONG STRING that needs to be truncated, and so this is a LONG STRING that needs to be truncated, and so this is a LONG STRING that needs to be TRUNCATED."
library(microbenchmark)
source("truncsmart_kearney.R")
source("truncsmart_orig.R")
```

#### Speed Test

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mb <- microbenchmark(
    "mine" = truncsmart(textstring, 20),
    "original" = truncsmart_og(textstring, 20))
```


#### Results

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mb
plot(mb)
```
