\section{Background}

My research examines the intersection of new media environments and
political communication using innovative quantitative research methods.
My current work analyzes ``big data'' to better understand the
relationship between selective exposure and social media. In working to systematically collect and wrangle large amounts of data,
I created and now maintain \emph{rtweet}, the successor package to
\emph{twitteR} for collecting Twitter data. Originally developed to collect
data for my dissertation, \emph{rtweet} now features numerous diverse
methods for interacting with Twitter APIs and represents the future of
open-source efforts in collecting Twitter data.

\section{Proposal}

Most of the work toward creating the package is done. I have
already published \textit{rtweet} on CRAN and have received a fair amount
of feedback via email and Github. I still want to add a couple new
features and implement at least a handful of improvements, but my
next big goal is to advertise the package and have my work count toward
something a little more tangible. With this in mind, for my semester project
in \textit{Statistical Computing and Foundations}, I propose I write and
submit an article about \textit{rtweet} to the \textit{R Journal}.

\section{Details}

As an introductory piece, the article will provide three different overviews.
First, the article will provide an introduction to working with
Twitterâ€™s APIs. This section will also include some basic discussion about the
the nature and limitations of publically available Twitter data. Second,
I will provide an overview of the major functions and features in
\textit{rtweet}. Third, I will provide quick examples of different statitical
analyses, including sentiment [textual] analysis, social network analysis,
and time series.

The R Journal encourages authors to discuss similar packages, so I would like
to provide some points of comparison between \textit{rtweet} and \textit{twitteR}. In the third section described above, I would also demonstrate
how to make \textit{rtweet} compatible with several statistical packages.
This may also feature integration with \textit{data.table} or other ways
to work with relational databases.
