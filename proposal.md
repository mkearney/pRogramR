## Term Paper Proposal:
### rtweet: Collecting Twitter Data


My research examines the intersection of new media environments and
political communication using innovative quantitative research methods.
My current work analyzes ``big data'' to better understand the
relationship between selective exposure and social media.

In working to systematically collect and wrangle large amounts of data,
I created and now maintain \emph{rtweet}, the successor package to
\emph{twitteR} for collecting Twitter data. Originally developed to collect
data for my dissertation, \emph{rtweet} now features numerous diverse
methods for interacting with Twitter APIs and represents the future of
open-source efforts in collecting Twitter data.

\section{proposal}

Most of the work toward creating the package is already done. I have
already published \textit{rtweet} on CRAN and have received a fair amount
of feedback via email and Github. I still want to add a couple new
features and implement at least a handful of improvements, but my
next big goal is to advertise the package and have my work count toward
something a little more tangible. With this in mind, for my course project
in \textit{Statistical Computing and Foundations}, I propose that I write and
submit an article about \textit{rtweet} to the \textit{R Journal}.
